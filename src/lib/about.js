In music, the term "woodshedding" refers to the act of rehearsing a difficult
phrase, excerpt, or motive. The proverbial woodshed represents an environment of singular focus,
affording the performer the time, space, and freedom required to perfect a musical passage.

woodshed.io exists to add a collaborative dimension to this typically insular practice;
the Noodle interface, like other music notation software, lets you jot down a quick sketch of what you're
shedding. However, unlike other music notation software, woodshed.io is itself a platform for sharing
such ideas. Be it a phrase you've extracted from a challenging transcription, a melodic fragment you're
working out in twelve keys, or just a sick lick that brought down the house at your last gig,
it surely belongs in the woodshed.

So, what are you waiting for? And, more importantly, what are you practicing?

Special thanks to the VexFlow music notation library for JavaScript, without which this project would
have been a much greater challenge to realize.
